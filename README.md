Call Center Performance Dashboard – Power BI

Designed and developed an interactive dashboard to analyze 32K+ customer calls across multiple channels (Call Center, Chatbot, Web, Email).

Implemented KPIs including Total Calls, Talk Time, Avg Duration, Response Rate, and Sentiment Analysis.

Applied a custom red–orange theme to highlight critical metrics and improve visual storytelling, moving beyond the standard white/blue corporate palette.

Added interactive filters (Date, City, Channel) to enable drill-down analysis by geography, channel, and call reasons.

Enhanced data storytelling with visuals like trend analysis, sentiment distribution, calls by state, and channel performance.
